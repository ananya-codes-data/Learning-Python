# operators in python

# 1. Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, / etc.
# 2. Assignment operators: =, +=, -= etc.
# 3. Comparison operators: ==, >, >=, <, != etc.
# 4. Logical operators: and, or, not.

# Arithmetic Operators

# 7 + 4 = 11
# 7 & 4 are operands
# + is the operator
# 11 is the result

# a = 21
# b = 22
# c = a + b

# print(c)

# Assignment operators

# a = 4 - 2 # Assign 4 - 2 in a
# print(a)
# b = 6

# b += 3 # Increment the value of b by 3 and then assign it to b
# b -= 3 # Decrement the value of b by 3 and then assign it to b
# b *= 3 # Multiply the value of b with 3 and then assign it to b
# b /= 3 # Divide the value of b by 3 and then assign it to b

# print(b)

# Comparison operators

# d = 5 < 4 # Is 5 less than 4
# d = 5 > 4 # Is 5 more than 4
# d = 5 >= 5 # Is 5 more than equal to 5
# d = 5 <= 5 # Is 5 less than equal to 5
# d = 5 != 7 # Is 5 not equal to 7
# d = 5 == 5 # Is 5 equal to 5

# print(d)


# Logical operators

# e = True or False

# Truth table of 'or'
# print("True or False is ", True or False)
# print("True or True is ", True or True)
# print("False or True is ", False or True)
# print("False or False is ", False or False)

# Truth table of 'and'
# print("True and False is ", True and False)
# print("True and True is ", True and True)
# print("False and True is ", False and True)
# print("False and False is ", False and False)

# multi cursor functionality
# press alt and where ever you click cursor will apply and we can do that multiple times


# print(not(False))

# print(not(True))


# type function - function to find data type of any variable

# a = 31
# t = type(a) # class <int>

# a = 31.2
# t = type(a) # class <float>

# a = "ananya"
# t = type(a) # class <str>

# a = "22.10"
# t = type(a) # class <str>

# a = "22.10"
# b = float(a) # a but the type should be float
# t = type(b) # class <float>

# print(t)

# str(31) =>"31" # integer to string conversion
# int("32") => 32 # string to integer conversion
# float(32) => 32.0 # integer to float conversion


# input function -
